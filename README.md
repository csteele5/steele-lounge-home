## Summary
This is the entry point for all Internet facing resources made public for demo purposes or personal use.

## Design Notes
The landing site is hosted on S3 as a static web page with links to other AWS resources as needed.  To minimize S3 bucket usage, reference links to external resources will be used when practical.
